A favicon is a small image that is displayed next to the page title in the browser tab. It helps users to identify and recognize a website or a web page quickly and easily. A favicon can also appear in other places, such as bookmarks, history, search results, and mobile devices. A favicon is usually a simplified version of the logo or the design of the website.
